## Issue 1: Cloudflare Pages Build Fails on "generating Pages Functions"

### Symptoms

The build process for the Vite/React frontend completes successfully, but the deployment fails with an error similar to this in the logs:

```
✘ [ERROR] Expected ";" but found "contents"

../../../buildhome/repo/functions/api/submit.js:1:5:
  1 │ full contents of functions/api/submit.js
    │      ~~~~~~~~
    ╵      ;

[ERROR] Build failed with 1 error:
...
Failed: generating Pages Functions failed.
```

### Root Cause

The error indicates that a file inside the `/functions` directory contains invalid JavaScript syntax. In this specific case, the file `functions/api/submit.js` contained the placeholder text `full contents of functions/api/submit.js` instead of the actual, executable serverless function code.

The Cloudflare Pages build process attempts to parse and bundle all files in the `/functions` directory, and it will fail if any of them are not valid JavaScript or TypeScript files.

### Solution

1.  **Identify the Problematic File:** The error log will point to the exact file and line causing the issue.
2.  **Replace Placeholder Content:** Ensure the identified file contains complete and syntactically correct JavaScript/TypeScript code. Remove any placeholder text.
3.  **Verify Function Logic:** The function code should correctly implement its intended logic (e.g., handling form data, calling external APIs).
4.  **Commit and Redeploy:** Commit the corrected file to your repository and trigger a new deployment on Cloudflare Pages.

This type of error is a reminder to always ensure that all committed files, especially those intended for server-side execution like Cloudflare Functions, contain valid code and not just placeholder notes.
